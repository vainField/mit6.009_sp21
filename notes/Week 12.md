# <u>L-1. Programming Beyond 6.009</u>

## Overview

### Goals

- Programming: analyzing problems, developing plans 
- Coding: translating plans into Python 
- Debugging: developing test cases, verifying correctness, finding and fixing errors

### Strategy

- high-level design strategies 
- ways to manage complexity 
  - style: PEP 8
  - abstraction
- details and ”goodies” of Python 
- a mental model of Python’s operation 
- testing and debugging strategies

### Labs

- Audio Processing 
- Image Processing − Convolutional Filters − Color Images − Seam Carving 
- Bacon Numbers / Path Finding 
- Path Planning in the USA
- N-dimensional Minesweeper 
- SAT Solver 
- Autocomplete 
- Symbolic Algebra 
- LISP Interpreter

### Overview

- improving “behind the scenes” understanding 
- managing complexity as programs grow 
- filling your “toolbox” with common techniques/strategies 
- practice with programming, coding, and debugging

## What’s Next?

### Python Standard Library Highlights

Another reason to like Python (which we’ve not really utilized so far) is that it has a huge standard library of useful modules/functions/classes. We certainly can’t talk about it all here (see https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html, the list is huge), but we can talk briefly about a couple of highlights: 

- various collections (beyond lists, sets, etc): `collections` 
- tools for working with iterators and functions: `itertools`, `functools` 
- mathy things: `math`, `cmath`, `random`, `statistics` 
- rational numbers: `fractions` 
- tools for working with functions: `functools` 
- implementations of built-in operations as functions: `operator` 
- tools for interacting with operating system: `os`, `sys` 
- tools for dealing with errors/reporting: `traceback`, `logging` 
- tools for creating/interacting with Internet protocols/etc 
  - `email`, smtplib, etc 
  - `http.server`, `urllib.request`, etc

### External Packages

- `sympy` for symbolic algebra 
- `numpy` for numeric computation (fast operations on large multi-dim arrays+matrices) 
- `matplotlib` for generating plots 
- `nltk` for natural language processing 
- `mypy` for static analysis of code 
- etc, etc, etc
